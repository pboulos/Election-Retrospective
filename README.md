# Election Retrospective

In 2015, there was a changing of the guard in Canadian politics. Stephen Harper, the leader of the Conservative party had been prime minister since 2006, and many Canadians felt that the time was right for a change. Enter Justin Trudeau, with a name of significant political heft in Canadian circles. Said heft was brought about by his father, Pierre Trudeau, the third longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history.

In this small retrospective, we'll examine the shift of consensus between the 2011 and 2015 Canadian federal elections. Along the way, we may discover certain interesting results and may make some unorthodox comparisons for the sake of political levity (if such a thing were possible?).

The data that was used is all publicly available from official governmental sources and was processed for the sake of simplification and clarity. Data is rarely clean, political data (it seems) less so. It should be noted for the sake of early disclosure that this project does not have visualisations that are particularly colourblind-friendly.

## Modules You'll Need to Clone 

It's easiest to clone this if you have Python installed within an Anaconda environment (ideally conda-forge). However, should you wish to have an explicit list of modules that you would need, here it is:

- pandas                    0.24.2 
- geopandas                 0.4.1
- matplotlib                3.0.3
- seaborn                   0.9.0
- scipy                     1.2.1

It's possible that the notebook will function with versions lower than this, but for declarative clarity I opted to include the ones that the notebook was created on.

In the unlikely event that any of these charts are used somewhere else, please get in touch with me first!
